# init_history files

Init_history files save the timestamp of the last time the node was initialized.
This allows us to understand the current behavior of the node:

- If it's the first time running, the node will only connect to the previous nodes of the config file (nodes_config.yaml).
- If it's not the first time running, the node will connect to all the nodes of the config file, except itself.

This folder can be cleared if you want to reset the networks's behavior.
This is achieved by calling the "clean-init-history.sh": `./clean-init-history.sh`
